A toast, to Isaiah and his ability to code silly things that no one needs.

I don't like public speaking, unless I'm doing a video, because of the fact that if I screw up, it stays. If you are editing a video, you can just record again, and keep going on. But when I am public speaking live, once when you mess up, you make things a bit awkward.
