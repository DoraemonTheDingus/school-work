Topic: Homebrew (and hacking in general)
Purpose: Don't think that one popular sub group is the only group that you need to know.

Brainstorm:

-Beginning

-It's not illegal
-It isn't harmful (if you know what you are doing)
-Not all hackers are out there to steal your data
-It does not require a degree in virginity in order to homebrew.

-refrain

-it actually can help your console's life.
-hackers can do more than the original vendor
-we aren't all pirates.
-we don't condone piracy.
-we are not against the vendors.

-conclousion

-Don't think that becuase the bad sub group is big, it is all that it is.
