Topic: Homebrew (and hacking in general)
Purpose: Don't think that one popular sub group is the only group that you need to know.

Brainstorm:
-It's not illegal
-It isn't harmful (if you know what you are doing)
-Not all hackers are out there to steal your data
-It does not require a degree in virginity in order to homebrew.
